Setting up on Vlab:
1. Download our source code, leftovers-filmfinity.zip file on Vlab to a location of your choosing. Preferably in a separate empty folder.
2. Unzip the leftovers-filmfinity.zip file. You will now see 2 folders, private_html and public_html.
3. Using a terminal, such as UXTerm, change directory into the public_html folder using something like:
  cd <path to public_html>
  You will know you are in the correct directory if you type ls into the terminal and see files such as login.php, signup.php, quiz.php.
4. In the same terminal, type the command php -S localhost:4029
  Sometimes a port may be in use, therefore, you can change the last 4 numbers to a random 4 digit number between 4000 and 5000.
5. To use the website, simply open a web browser and type localhost:4029 (or whatever port you chose) into the url box.
6. Enjoy your FilmFinity experience!

Alternative set up:
If you donâ€™t want to go through the setup process, simply visit http://filmfinity.me/. It is an exact copy of the source code, but online.
