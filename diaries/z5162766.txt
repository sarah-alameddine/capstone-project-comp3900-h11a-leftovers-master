Week 1 
We formed the group. The scrum master (Yush) created the Jira account and organised our meeting on teams.
We split the user stories up and we each have aims to finish them before our meeting on Monday.

Week 2
We had a meeting on Monday on Teams, where we discussed User stories and planned what language/tools we will use for the assignment (PHP,Bootstrap,MySQL).
During our meeting we started to discuss the proposal and we split it up, so i have been assigned Technical depth- Storyboards/Prototyping. 
We are confused on what is meant by Storyboard - we will ask Rachid our tutor.
On Wednesday i finished uploading my user stories (Movie page & Film search) and their corresponding acceptance criteria to Jira.
We also organised the user stories into different sprints. 
We joined the github classroom on Wednesday.
