Week 1

Group was formed. We had a discussion about what project we will choose. We ended up chooseing FilmFinder. We also scheduled a meeting to do the assignment on Week 2 Monday at 2PM. We also did a quick brainstorm of the rough functionalities we wanted our project to have.

Week 2

We met at 2PM on Monday. We discussed and wrote down as a group all the user stories we wanted and sorted these user stories into sprints. We also allocated the tasks were required to do in the report.

Week 3

We met at 4:30PM on Tuesday to discuss our proposal work. We had all mostly completed most of our tasks. Thus, we reviewed the entire document as a whole and ironed out any big problematic issues. We then assigned each other a section of the proposal to peer review so we could peer review our own project document. I was assigeed Aayushma's Background section. I peer reviewed her section on Thursday. Xuan peer reviewed the Technical section which I wrote on Thursday too. Xuan peer reviewed my section and left comments where I could improve. I then applied those changes to the document on Thursday as well.
